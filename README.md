# python-2048
Implementation of the classical 2048 game as console version using Python.

You play by entering "L" for left, "R" for right, "O" for up or "U" for down.

The first two numbers appear randomly on the board and can be either 2 or 4.

After every move a new number gets placed but only if the move changed the board.

Same numbers can be merged and every merge increases the score.

Game is over if no legal moves are left.
